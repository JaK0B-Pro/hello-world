# hello-world
The Hello World project is a time-honored tradition in computer programming.It is a simple exercise that gets you started when learning something new.
i am a guy who like to expert in cyber security field and programming field also that i joined GitHub is actually to search for a tool called "tree", then i was realized that i forgot my old account password (which was nothing in it) so i deleted the old one and created new one and then this hello-world project in my home screen, so i thought is should take it to learn better about GitHub and continue my learning on the course of the ethical hacking.
